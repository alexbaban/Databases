# MongoDB

MongoDB is an open source database that uses a document-oriented data model. 

Instead of storing your data in tables made out of individual rows, like a relational database does, it stores your data in collections made out of individual documents. 

In MongoDB, a document is a big JSON blob with no particular format or schema.
